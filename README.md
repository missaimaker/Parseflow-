# Parseflow

Parseflow is a multi-language repository containing a C-based grammar parser and a Python cellular life simulation. The projects demonstrate concepts from compiler design, algorithm development, and parallel computing.

## C Grammar Parser
This component implements grammar parsing techniques using recursive descent concepts in C. It processes structured grammar inputs and demonstrates syntax handling and low-level parsing logic.

Skills used:
- C programming
- Recursive descent parsing
- Compiler design fundamentals

## Python Cellular Life Simulator
This component simulates the evolution of a grid of cells using mathematical rules such as prime numbers, Fibonacci sequences, and powers of two. It supports both serial and parallel execution using Python multiprocessing.

Skills used:
- Python programming
- Parallel processing
- Algorithmic simulation
- File handling

## Learning Outcomes
Through these projects, I strengthened my understanding of parsing algorithms, systems programming, parallel computing, and efficient software design across multiple languages.
